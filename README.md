## A couple of UAMMD usage examples

UAMMD comes with a lot of examples and tutorials (check the [uammd](https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/UAMMD) page).   
In this repo you can find a couple of selected examples that were discussed during the CECAM conference at Bilbao.  
One of them reproduces the "falling logo" simulation that you can see in the UAMMD repository page. The other one showcases how to use UAMMD communicate a group of particles and a grid.  

The slides contain some information about the solvers in UAMMD, as well as providing an introduction to the infrastructure itself.  
If you want to learn more about UAMMD, you can check its documentation:

[uammd.readthedocs.io](https://uammd.readthedocs.io)

You can also check out my [Ph.D. manuscript](https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/phd) or my [dissertation](https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/phd-dissertation). Both of them introduce UAMMD, its novelties and the algorithms that the framework exposes.



## Try it on google collab:

I prepared a guided google collab page where you can try out the examples in this repo (collab provides a GPU for free).

This repository includes uammd as a submodule, so remember to clone recursively:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/2022Bilbao
```
