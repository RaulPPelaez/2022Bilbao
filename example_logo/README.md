### Falling logo

In this example we will write a simulation with the UAMMD letters, represented by a concentration of ideal particles, falling inside a fluid.

We will learn to:	
1. Initialize an UAMMD particle container
1. Write an Interactor encoding gravity
1. Initialize hydrodynamic Integrator
